# heka-swift-package

Swift package to integrate with Heka and get data from various fitness and health data sources.

Integrate Apple Healthkit, Fitbit and other fitness data sources in your app with just 4 lines of code.

Integrating health data from smart watches is not easy and requires understanding how various smart watches and operating systems work. On top of that, the way to get data reliability from different sources is different with data format also being different.

The Heka smartwatch integration makes it easy to integrate various watches and reliably get data on the server. With a couple of one-time setup steps, 4 lines of code and you have integrated all smart devices into your product.

## Creating an app on Heka Dashboard

1. Create an account on our web app at [HekaHealth Dashboard](https://appdev.hekahealth.co).
2. Register your application.
3. Creating an app will provide you with an HekaHealth API Key. This you will require when integrating the HekaHealth SDK on the app side.

Thatâ€™s all you need to do on the dashboard side.

## Installation

Heka supports both Cocoapods and Swift Package Manager for dependency management.

#### Cocoapods

With Cocoapods, add the following to your Podfile:

```swift
pod 'heka'
```

Then, run `pod install`

#### Swift Package Manager

With Swift Package Manager, add the following `dependency` to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/HekaHealth/heka-swift-package.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.5"))
]
```

## Setup

1) Append the `Info.plist` with the following 2 entries:

```swift
<key>NSHealthShareUsageDescription</key>
<string>We will sync your data with the Apple Health app to give you better insights</string>
<key>NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription</key>
<string>We will sync your data with the Apple Health app to give you better insights</string>
```

2) Open your Flutter project in Xcode by right-clicking on the `ios` folder and selecting `Open in Xcode`. Next, enable `HealthKit` by adding a capability inside the `Signing & Capabilities` tab of the Runner target's settings. Also, make sure to enable the background delivery option.

3) To make sure that health data is being synced even while on background, initialize the sync observers in `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method of `AppDelegate.swift`:

```swift
import heka     // Make sure you import Heka

// ...

func application(_ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    // ....
    HekaManager().installObservers()
    return true
}
```


## Usage

Import the SDK by adding the following:

```swift
import heka
```

To render the UI component with state management and syncing logic plugged in, add the following lines:

```swift
HekaUIView(
    uuid: "<user-uuid-goes-here>",
    apiKey: "<your-api-key-goes-here>"
)
```

## Getting the data

The collected data is unified in a single format and sent to the webhook URL configured while registering the app on our dashboard. Check out our relevant [documentation](https://heka-health.notion.site/Getting-data-on-the-server-Heka-94ae2c8228ad426c9a45f3ac1d7312fe).


## Sample app

A sample app that uses the `HekaUIView` can be found at [heka-ios-sample](https://github.com/HekaHealth/heka-ios-sample).

## FAQs

**Q.** If the user denies Apple Healthkit permission, it doesn't show any error and connects. Shouldn't it prevent connecting and show an error message about permission not being granted?

**Ans.** Unfortunately, Apple Healthkit provides no way to detect if a user has granted permission or not due to privacy reasons. The queries that get data from Healthkit don't return an error and rather return an empty list if permissions are not granted.
We think the best way to handle this is to ask users to make sure permissions are granted from the health app if data is not getting synced.
